# Simple Java repo, where I learn/training skills by implementing cryptography algorithms

Cyphers:
- [x] ROT - basic algorithm, based on rotating alphabet 
- [x] Vigen√®re cipher - based on ROT, with dynamic rotation
- [ ] DES - Data Encryption Standard, binary algorithm

TODO list:
- [ ] Implement dependency injection pattern
